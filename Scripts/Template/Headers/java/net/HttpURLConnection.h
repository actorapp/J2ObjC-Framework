/*!
 @brief An <code>URLConnection</code> for HTTP (<a
 href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>) used to send and
 receive data over the web.
 Data may be of any type and length. This class may
 be used to send and receive streaming data whose length is not known in
 advance.
 <p>Uses of this class follow a pattern:
 <ol>
 <li>Obtain a new <code>HttpURLConnection</code> by calling <code>URL.openConnection()</code>
  and casting the result to
 <code>HttpURLConnection</code>.
 <li>Prepare the request. The primary property of a request is its URI.
 Request headers may also include metadata such as credentials, preferred
 content types, and session cookies.
 <li>Optionally upload a request body. Instances must be configured with
 <code>setDoOutput(true)</code> if they include a
 request body. Transmit data by writing to the stream returned by <code>getOutputStream()</code>
 .
 <li>Read the response. Response headers typically include metadata such as
 the response body's content type and length, modified dates and session
 cookies. The response body may be read from the stream returned by <code>getInputStream()</code>
 . If the response has no body, that method returns an
 empty stream.
 <li>Disconnect. Once the response body has been read, the <code>HttpURLConnection</code>
  should be closed by calling <code>disconnect()</code>.
 Disconnecting releases the resources held by a connection so they may
 be closed or reused.
 </ol>
 <p>For example, to retrieve the webpage at <code>http://www.android.com/</code>:
 @code
     URL url = new URL("http://www.android.com/");
   HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   try 
     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
     readStream(in);
   } finally {
     urlConnection.disconnect();
   }
  
@endcode
 <h3>Secure Communication with HTTPS</h3>
 Calling <code>URL.openConnection()</code> on a URL with the "https"
 scheme will return an <code>HttpsURLConnection</code>, which allows for
 overriding the default <code>HostnameVerifier</code>
  and <code>SSLSocketFactory</code>
 . An application-supplied <code>SSLSocketFactory</code>
 created from an <code>SSLContext</code> can
 provide a custom <code>X509TrustManager</code>
  for verifying certificate chains and a custom
 <code>X509KeyManager</code> for supplying
 client certificates. See <code>HttpsURLConnection</code>
  for more details.
 <h3>Response Handling</h3>
 <code>HttpURLConnection</code> will follow up to five HTTP redirects. It will
 follow redirects from one origin server to another. This implementation
 doesn't follow redirects from HTTPS to HTTP or vice versa.
 <p>If the HTTP response indicates that an error occurred, <code>getInputStream()</code>
  will throw an <code>IOException</code>. Use <code>getErrorStream()</code>
  to read the error response. The headers can be read in
 the normal way using <code>getHeaderFields()</code>,
 <h3>Posting Content</h3>
 To upload data to a web server, configure the connection for output using
 <code>setDoOutput(true)</code>.
 <p>For best performance, you should call either <code>setFixedLengthStreamingMode(int)</code>
  when the body length is known in advance,
 or <code>setChunkedStreamingMode(int)</code> when it is not. Otherwise <code>HttpURLConnection</code>
  will be forced to buffer the complete request body in
 memory before it is transmitted, wasting (and possibly exhausting) heap and
 increasing latency.
 <p>For example, to perform an upload: 
@code
     HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   try 
     urlConnection.setDoOutput(true);
     urlConnection.setChunkedStreamingMode(0);
     OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(urlConnection.getOutputStream());
     writeStream(out);
     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
     readStream(in);
   } finally {
     urlConnection.disconnect();
   }
  
@endcode
 <h3>Performance</h3>
 The input and output streams returned by this class are <strong>not
 buffered</strong>. Most callers should wrap the returned streams with <code>BufferedInputStream</code>
  or <code>BufferedOutputStream</code>
 . Callers that do only bulk
 reads or writes may omit buffering.
 <p>When transferring large amounts of data to or from a server, use streams
 to limit how much data is in memory at once. Unless you need the entire
 body to be in memory at once, process it as a stream (rather than storing
 the complete body as a single byte array or string).
 <p>To reduce latency, this class may reuse the same underlying <code>Socket</code>
 for multiple request/response pairs. As a result, HTTP connections may be
 held open longer than necessary. Calls to <code>disconnect()</code> may return
 the socket to a pool of connected sockets. This behavior can be disabled by
 setting the <code>http.keepAlive</code> system property to <code>false</code> before
 issuing any HTTP requests. The <code>http.maxConnections</code> property may be
 used to control how many idle connections to each server will be held.
 <p>By default, this implementation of <code>HttpURLConnection</code> requests that
 servers use gzip compression. Since <code>getContentLength()</code> returns the
 number of bytes transmitted, you cannot use that method to predict how many
 bytes can be read from <code>getInputStream()</code>. Instead, read that stream
 until it is exhausted: when <code>InputStream.read</code> returns -1. Gzip
 compression can be disabled by setting the acceptable encodings in the
 request header: 
@code
     urlConnection.setRequestProperty("Accept-Encoding", "identity");
 
@endcode
 <h3>Handling Network Sign-On</h3>
 Some Wi-Fi networks block Internet access until the user clicks through a
 sign-on page. Such sign-on pages are typically presented by using HTTP
 redirects. You can use <code>getURL()</code> to test if your connection has been
 unexpectedly redirected. This check is not valid until <strong>after</strong>
 the response headers have been received, which you can trigger by calling
 <code>getHeaderFields()</code> or <code>getInputStream()</code>. For example, to
 check that a response was not redirected to an unexpected host:
 @code
     HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   try 
     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
     if (!url.getHost().equals(urlConnection.getURL().getHost())) {
       // we were redirected! Kick the user out to the browser to sign on?
     }
     ...
   } finally {
     urlConnection.disconnect();
   }
  
@endcode
 <h3>HTTP Authentication</h3>
 <code>HttpURLConnection</code> supports <a
 href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617">HTTP basic authentication</a>. Use
 <code>Authenticator</code> to set the VM-wide authentication handler:
 @code
   
   Authenticator.setDefault(new Authenticator() 
     protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
       return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password.toCharArray());
     }
   });
  
@endcode
 Unless paired with HTTPS, this is <strong>not</strong> a secure mechanism for
 user authentication. In particular, the username, password, request and
 response are all transmitted over the network without encryption.
 <h3>Sessions with Cookies</h3>
 To establish and maintain a potentially long-lived session between client
 and server, <code>HttpURLConnection</code> includes an extensible cookie manager.
 Enable VM-wide cookie management using <code>CookieHandler</code> and <code>CookieManager</code>
 : 
@code
     CookieManager cookieManager = new CookieManager();
   CookieHandler.setDefault(cookieManager);
 
@endcode
 By default, <code>CookieManager</code> accepts cookies from the <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html">origin
 server</a> only. Two other policies are included: <code>CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL</code>
  and <code>CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_NONE</code>. Implement
 <code>CookiePolicy</code> to define a custom policy.
 <p>The default <code>CookieManager</code> keeps all accepted cookies in memory. It
 will forget these cookies when the VM exits. Implement <code>CookieStore</code> to
 define a custom cookie store.
 <p>In addition to the cookies set by HTTP responses, you may set cookies
 programmatically. To be included in HTTP request headers, cookies must have
 the domain and path properties set.
 <p>By default, new instances of <code>HttpCookie</code> work only with servers
 that support <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt">RFC 2965</a>
 cookies. Many web servers support only the older specification, <a
 href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt">RFC 2109</a>. For compatibility
 with the most web servers, set the cookie version to 0.
 <p>For example, to receive <code>www.twitter.com</code> in French: 
@code
     HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("lang", "fr");
   cookie.setDomain("twitter.com");
   cookie.setPath("/");
   cookie.setVersion(0);
   cookieManager.getCookieStore().add(new URI("http://twitter.com/"), cookie);
 
@endcode
 <h3>HTTP Methods</h3>
 <p><code>HttpURLConnection</code> uses the <code>GET</code> method by default. It will
 use <code>POST</code> if <code>setDoOutput(true)</code> has been called.
 Other HTTP methods (<code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>HEAD</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>
  and <code>TRACE</code>) can be used with <code>setRequestMethod</code>.
 <h3>Proxies</h3>
 By default, this class will connect directly to the <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html">origin
 server</a>. It can also connect via an <code>HTTP</code> or <code>SOCKS</code>
  proxy. To use a proxy, use <code>URL.openConnection(Proxy)</code>
  when creating the
 connection.
 <h3>IPv6 Support</h3>
 <p>This class includes transparent support for IPv6. For hosts with both IPv4
 and IPv6 addresses, it will attempt to connect to each of a host's addresses
 until a connection is established.
 <h3>Response Caching</h3>
 Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich, API level 15) includes a response cache. See
 <code>android.net.http.HttpResponseCache</code> for instructions on enabling HTTP
 caching in your application.
 <h3>Avoiding Bugs In Earlier Releases</h3>
 Prior to Android 2.2 (Froyo), this class had some frustrating bugs. In
 particular, calling <code>close()</code> on a readable <code>InputStream</code> could
 <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2939">poison the
 connection pool</a>. Work around this by disabling connection pooling:
 @code
   
  private void disableConnectionReuseIfNecessary() 
   // Work around pre-Froyo bugs in HTTP connection reuse.
   if (Integer.parseInt(Build.VERSION.SDK) < Build.VERSION_CODES.FROYO) {
     System.setProperty("http.keepAlive", "false");
   }
  
@endcode
 <p>Each instance of <code>HttpURLConnection</code> may be used for one
 request/response pair. Instances of this class are not thread safe.
