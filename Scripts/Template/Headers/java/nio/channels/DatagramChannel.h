/*!
 @brief A <code>DatagramChannel</code> is a selectable channel that represents a partial
 abstraction of a datagram socket.
 The <code>socket</code> method of this class can
 return the related <code>DatagramSocket</code> instance, which can handle the
 socket.
 <p>
 A datagram channel is open but not connected when created with the
 <code>open()</code> method. After it is connected, it will keep the connected
 status until it is disconnected or closed. The benefit of a connected channel
 is the reduced effort of security checks during send and receive. When
 invoking <code>read</code> or <code>write</code>, a connected channel is required.
 <p>
 Datagram channels are thread-safe; only one thread can read or write at the
 same time.
