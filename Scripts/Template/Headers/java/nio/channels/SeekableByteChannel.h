/*!
 @brief An interface for channels that keep a pointer to a current position within an underlying
 byte-based data source such as a file.
 <p>SeekableByteChannels have a pointer into the underlying data source which is referred to as a
 <em>position</em>. The position can be manipulated by moving it within the data source, and the
 current position can be queried.
 <p>SeekableByteChannels also have an associated <em>size</em>. The size of the channel is the
 number of bytes that the data source currently contains. The size of the data source can be
 manipulated by adding more bytes to the end or by removing bytes from the end. See
 <code>truncate</code>, <code>position</code> and <code>write</code> for details. The current size can also
 be queried.
  Until ready for a public API change
 @since 1.7
