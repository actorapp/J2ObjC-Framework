 @brief A controller for the selection of <code>SelectableChannel</code> objects.
 Selectable channels can be registered with a selector and get a
 <code>SelectionKey</code> that represents the registration. The keys are also
 added to the selector's key set. Selection keys can be canceled so that the
 corresponding channel is no longer registered with the selector.
 <p>
 By invoking the <code>select</code> method, the key set is checked and all keys
 that have been canceled since last select operation are moved to the set of
 canceled keys. During the select operation, the channels registered with this
 selector are checked to see whether they are ready for operation according to
 their <code>interest set</code>.
