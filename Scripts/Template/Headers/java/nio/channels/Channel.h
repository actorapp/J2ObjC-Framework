/*!
 @brief A channel is a conduit to I/O services covering such items as files, sockets,
 hardware devices, I/O ports or some software component.
 <p>
 Channels are open upon creation, and can be closed explicitly. Once a channel
 is closed it cannot be re-opened, and any attempts to perform I/O operations
 on the closed channel result in a <code>ClosedChannelException</code>.
 <p>
 Particular implementations or sub-interfaces of <code>Channel</code> dictate
 whether they are thread-safe or not.

/*!
 @brief Closes an open channel.
 If the channel is already closed then this method
 has no effect. If there is a problem with closing the channel then the
 method throws an IOException and the exception contains reasons for the
 failure.
 <p>
 If an attempt is made to perform an operation on a closed channel then a
 <code>ClosedChannelException</code> will be thrown on that attempt.
 <p>
 If multiple threads attempt to simultaneously close a channel, then only
 one thread will run the closure code, and others will be blocked until
 the first returns.
