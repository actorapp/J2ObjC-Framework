/*!
 @brief <code>AbstractInterruptibleChannel</code> is the root class for interruptible
 channels.
 <p>
 The basic usage pattern for an interruptible channel is to invoke
 <code>begin()</code> before any I/O operation that potentially blocks
 indefinitely, then <code>end(boolean)</code> after completing the operation. The
 argument to the <code>end</code> method should indicate if the I/O operation has
 actually completed so that any change may be visible to the invoker.

 @brief Closes an open channel.
 If the channel is already closed then this method
 has no effect, otherwise it closes the receiver via the
 <code>implCloseChannel</code> method.
 <p>
 If an attempt is made to perform an operation on a closed channel then a
 <code>java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException</code> is thrown.
 <p>
 If multiple threads attempt to simultaneously close a channel, then only
 one thread will run the closure code and the others will be blocked until
 the first one completes.
