 @brief A channel that can be used with a <code>Selector</code>.
 The channel must be
 registered with a selector by calling one of the <code>register</code> methods,
 which return a <code>SelectionKey</code> object. In order to deregister a channel
 from a selector, its selection key must be canceled. This can be done
 explicitly by calling the <code>SelectionKey.cancel()</code> method but it is also
 done implicitly when the channel or the selector is closed.
 <p>
 A channel may be registered with several selectors at the same time but only
 once for any given selector.
