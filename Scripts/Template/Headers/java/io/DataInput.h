@class IOSByteArray;

/*!
 @brief Defines an interface for classes that are able to read big-endian typed data from some
 source.
 Typically, this data has been written by a class which implements
 <code>DataOutput</code>. Types that can be read include byte, 16-bit short, 32-bit
 int, 32-bit float, 64-bit long, 64-bit double, byte strings, and MUTF-8
 strings.
 <h3>MUTF-8 (Modified UTF-8) Encoding</h3>
 <p>
 When encoding strings as UTF, implementations of <code>DataInput</code> and
 <code>DataOutput</code> use a slightly modified form of UTF-8, hereafter referred
 to as MUTF-8. This form is identical to standard UTF-8, except:
 <ul>
 <li>Only the one-, two-, and three-byte encodings are used.</li>
 <li>Code points in the range <code>U+10000</code> &hellip;
 <code>U+10ffff</code> are encoded as a surrogate pair, each of which is
 represented as a three-byte encoded value.</li>
 <li>The code point <code>U+0000</code> is encoded in two-byte form.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Please refer to <a href="http://unicode.org">The Unicode Standard</a> for
 further information about character encoding. MUTF-8 is actually closer to
 the (relatively less well-known) encoding <a
 href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr26/">CESU-8</a> than to UTF-8 per se.
