 @brief Reads at most <code>count</code> bytes from this sequence of input streams and

 Blocks only until at least 1 byte has been read, the end of the stream
 has been reached, or an exception is thrown.
 <p>
 This SequenceInputStream shows the same behavior as other InputStreams.
 To do this it will read only as many bytes as a call to read on the
 current substream returns. If that call does not return as many bytes as
 requested by <code>count</code>, it will not retry to read more on its own
 because subsequent reads might block. This would violate the rule that
 it will only block until at least one byte has been read.
 <p>
 If a substream has already reached the end when this call is made, it
 will close that substream and start with the next one. If there are no
 more substreams it will return -1.
 @param buffer
 the array in which to store the bytes read.
 @param offset
 the initial position in <code>buffer</code> to store the bytes read
 from this stream.
 @param count
 the maximum number of bytes to store in <code>buffer</code>.
 @return the number of bytes actually read; -1 if this sequence of streams
 is closed or if the end of the last stream in the sequence has
 been reached.
 @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
 if <code>offset < 0</code> or <code>count < 0</code>, or if <code>offset + count</code>
  is greater than the size of <code>buffer</code>.
 @throws IOException
 if an I/O error occurs.
