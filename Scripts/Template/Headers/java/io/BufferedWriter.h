/*!
 @brief Wraps an existing <code>Writer</code> and <em>buffers</em> the output.
 Expensive
 interaction with the underlying reader is minimized, since most (smaller)
 requests can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that
 some extra space is required to hold the buffer and that copying takes place
 when filling that buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance
 benefits.
 <p/>A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:<p/>
 @code

  BufferedWriter buf = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;file.java&quot;));
  
@endcode
