/*!
 @brief An <code>ExecutorService</code> that can schedule commands to run after a given
 delay, or to execute periodically.
 <p>The <code>schedule</code> methods create tasks with various delays
 and return a task object that can be used to cancel or check
 execution. The <code>scheduleAtFixedRate</code> and
 <code>scheduleWithFixedDelay</code> methods create and execute tasks
 that run periodically until cancelled.
 <p>Commands submitted using the <code>Executor.execute(Runnable)</code>
 and <code>ExecutorService</code> <code>submit</code> methods are scheduled
 with a requested delay of zero. Zero and negative delays (but not
 periods) are also allowed in <code>schedule</code> methods, and are
 treated as requests for immediate execution.
 <p>All <code>schedule</code> methods accept <em>relative</em> delays and
 periods as arguments, not absolute times or dates. It is a simple
 matter to transform an absolute time represented as a <code>java.util.Date</code>
  to the required form. For example, to schedule at
 a certain future <code>date</code>, you can use: <code>schedule(task,
 date.getTime() - System.currentTimeMillis(),
 TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)</code>
 . Beware however that expiration of a
 relative delay need not coincide with the current <code>Date</code> at
 which the task is enabled due to network time synchronization
 protocols, clock drift, or other factors.
 <p>The <code>Executors</code> class provides convenient factory methods for
 the ScheduledExecutorService implementations provided in this package.
 <h3>Usage Example</h3>
 Here is a class with a method that sets up a ScheduledExecutorService
 to beep every ten seconds for an hour:
 @code
  import static java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.*;
  class BeeperControl 
   private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
     Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
   public void beepForAnHour() {
     final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
       public void run() { System.out.println("beep"); }
     };
     final ScheduledFuture<?> beeperHandle =
       scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
     scheduler.schedule(new Runnable() {
       public void run() { beeperHandle.cancel(true); }
     }, 60 * 60, SECONDS);
   }
