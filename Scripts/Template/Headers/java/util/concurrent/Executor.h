/*!
 @brief An object that executes submitted <code>Runnable</code> tasks.
 This
 interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the
 mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread
 use, scheduling, etc.  An <code>Executor</code> is normally used
 instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than
 invoking <code>new Thread(new RunnableTask()).start()</code> for each
 of a set of tasks, you might use:
 @code

  Executor executor = <em>anExecutor</em>;
  executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
  executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
  ...
  
@endcode
 However, the <code>Executor</code> interface does not strictly
 require that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an
 executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's
 thread:
 @code
 
  class DirectExecutor implements Executor 
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     r.run();
   }
  
@endcode
 More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other
 than the caller's thread.  The executor below spawns a new thread
 for each task.
 @code
 
  class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor 
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     new Thread(r).start();
   }
  
@endcode
 Many <code>Executor</code> implementations impose some sort of
 limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled.  The executor below
 serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor,
 illustrating a composite executor.
 @code
 
  class SerialExecutor implements Executor 
   final Queue<Runnable> tasks = new ArrayDeque<>();
   final Executor executor;
   Runnable active;
   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
     this.executor = executor;
   }
   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
     tasks.add(new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
         try {
           r.run();
         } finally {
           scheduleNext();
         }
       }
     });
     if (active == null) {
       scheduleNext();
     }
   }
   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
       executor.execute(active);
     }
   }
  
@endcode
 The <code>Executor</code> implementations provided in this package
 implement <code>ExecutorService</code>, which is a more extensive
 interface.  The <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> class provides an
 extensible thread pool implementation. The <code>Executors</code> class
 provides convenient factory methods for these Executors.
 <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 submitting a <code>Runnable</code> object to an <code>Executor</code>

 its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.
