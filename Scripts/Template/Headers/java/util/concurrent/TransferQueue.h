/*!
 @brief A <code>BlockingQueue</code> in which producers may wait for consumers
 to receive elements.
 A <code>TransferQueue</code> may be useful for
 example in message passing applications in which producers
 sometimes (using method <code>transfer</code>) await receipt of
 elements by consumers invoking <code>take</code> or <code>poll</code>, while
 at other times enqueue elements (via method <code>put</code>) without
 waiting for receipt.
 Non-blocking and
 time-out versions of
 <code>tryTransfer</code> are also available.
 A <code>TransferQueue</code> may also be queried, via <code>hasWaitingConsumer</code>
 , whether there are any threads waiting for
 items, which is a converse analogy to a <code>peek</code> operation.
 <p>Like other blocking queues, a <code>TransferQueue</code> may be
 capacity bounded.  If so, an attempted transfer operation may
 initially block waiting for available space, and/or subsequently
 block waiting for reception by a consumer.  Note that in a queue
 with zero capacity, such as <code>SynchronousQueue</code>, <code>put</code>
 and <code>transfer</code> are effectively synonymous.
