 It is legitimate to make further changes to <code>s</code> from
 this callback, but be careful not to get yourself into an infinite
 loop, because any changes you make will cause this method to be
 called again recursively.
 (You are not told where the change took place because other
 afterTextChanged() methods may already have made other changes
 and invalidated the offsets.  But if you need to know here,
 you can use <code>Spannable.setSpan</code> in <code>onTextChanged</code>
 to mark your place and then look up from here where the span
 ended up.
