/*!
 @brief SAX2 extension to augment the per-attribute information
 provided though <code>Attributes</code>.
 If an implementation supports this extension, the attributes
 provided in <code>ContentHandler.startElement()</code>
  will implement this interface,
 and the <em>http://xml.org/sax/features/use-attributes2</em>
 feature flag will have the value <em>true</em>.
 <blockquote>
 <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
 </blockquote>
 <p> XMLReader implementations are not required to support this
 information, and it is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions.</p>
 <p>Note that if an attribute was defaulted (<em>!isSpecified()</em>)
 it will of necessity also have been declared (<em>isDeclared()</em>)
 in the DTD.
 Similarly if an attribute's type is anything except CDATA, then it
 must have been declared.
