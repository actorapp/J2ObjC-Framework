/*!
 @brief <code>DocumentFragment</code> is a "lightweight" or "minimal"
 <code>Document</code> object.
 It is very common to want to be able to
 extract a portion of a document's tree or to create a new fragment of a
 document. Imagine implementing a user command like cut or rearranging a
 document by moving fragments around. It is desirable to have an object
 which can hold such fragments and it is quite natural to use a Node for
 this purpose. While it is true that a <code>Document</code> object could
 fulfill this role, a <code>Document</code> object can potentially be a
 heavyweight object, depending on the underlying implementation. What is
 really needed for this is a very lightweight object.
 <code>DocumentFragment</code> is such an object.
 <p>Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children
 of another <code>Node</code> -- may take <code>DocumentFragment</code>
 objects as arguments; this results in all the child nodes of the
 <code>DocumentFragment</code> being moved to the child list of this node.
 <p>The children of a <code>DocumentFragment</code> node are zero or more
 nodes representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of
 the document. <code>DocumentFragment</code> nodes do not need to be
 well-formed XML documents (although they do need to follow the rules
 imposed upon well-formed XML parsed entities, which can have multiple top
 nodes). For example, a <code>DocumentFragment</code> might have only one
 child and that child node could be a <code>Text</code> node. Such a
 structure model represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML
 document.
 <p>When a <code>DocumentFragment</code> is inserted into a
 <code>Document</code> (or indeed any other <code>Node</code> that may
 take children) the children of the <code>DocumentFragment</code> and not
 the <code>DocumentFragment</code> itself are inserted into the
 <code>Node</code>. This makes the <code>DocumentFragment</code> very
 useful when the user wishes to create nodes that are siblings; the
 <code>DocumentFragment</code> acts as the parent of these nodes so that
 the user can use the standard methods from the <code>Node</code>
 interface, such as <code>Node.insertBefore</code> and
 <code>Node.appendChild</code>.
