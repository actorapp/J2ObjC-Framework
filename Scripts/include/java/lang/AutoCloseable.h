@protocol JavaLangAutoCloseable < JavaObject >

/*!
 @brief Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources.
 This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the
 <code>try</code>-with-resources statement.
 <p>While this interface method is declared to throw <code>Exception</code>
 , implementers are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to
 declare concrete implementations of the <code>close</code> method to
 throw more specific exceptions, or to throw no exception at all
 if the close operation cannot fail.
 <p><em>Implementers of this interface are also strongly advised
 to not have the <code>close</code> method throw <code>InterruptedException</code>
 .</em>
 This exception interacts with a thread's interrupted status,
 and runtime misbehavior is likely to occur if an <code>InterruptedException</code>
  is suppressed
 .
 More generally, if it would cause problems for an
 exception to be suppressed, the <code>AutoCloseable.close</code>
 method should not throw it.
 <p>Note that unlike the <code>close</code>
 method of <code>java.io.Closeable</code>, this <code>close</code> method
 is <em>not</em> required to be idempotent.  In other words,
 calling this <code>close</code> method more than once may have some
 visible side effect, unlike <code>Closeable.close</code> which is
 required to have no effect if called more than once.
 However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged
 to make their <code>close</code> methods idempotent.
 @throws Exception if this resource cannot be closed
