/*!
 @brief A state object for collecting statistics such as count, min, max, sum, and
 average.
 <p>This class is designed to work with (though does not require)
 streams. For example, you can compute
 summary statistics on a stream of doubles with:
 @code
  DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = doubleStream.collect(DoubleSummaryStatistics::new,
                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::accept,
                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::combine);
 
@endcode
 <p><code>DoubleSummaryStatistics</code> can be used as a
 reduction
 target for a stream. For example:
 @code
  DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = people.stream()
     .collect(Collectors.summarizingDouble(Person::getWeight));
 
@endcode
 This computes, in a single pass, the count of people, as well as the minimum,
 maximum, sum, and average of their weights.
  This implementation is not thread safe. However, it is safe to use
 <code>Collectors.toDoubleStatistics()</code>
  on a parallel stream, because the parallel
 implementation of <code>Stream.collect()</code>
 provides the necessary partitioning, isolation, and merging of results for
 safe and efficient parallel execution.

 order of addition operations of this method is intentionally
 not defined to allow for implementation flexibility to improve
 the speed and accuracy of the computed result.

 summation or other technique to reduce the error bound in the
 numerical sum compared to a simple summation of <code>double</code>
 values.
