/*!
 @brief Channels that implement this interface can be asynchronously closed and
 interrupted.
 <p>
 A channel that can be asynchronously closed permits that a thread blocked on
 an I/O operation (the I/O thread) can be released by another thread calling
 the channel's <code>close()</code> method. The I/O thread will throw an
 <code>AsynchronousCloseException</code> and the channel will be closed.
 <p>
 A channel that is interruptible permits a thread blocked on an I/O operation
 (the I/O thread) to be interrupted by another thread (by invoking
 <code>Thread.interrupt()</code> on the I/O thread). When the I/O thread is
 interrupted it will throw a <code>ClosedByInterruptException</code>, it will have
 its interrupted status set and the channel will be closed. If the I/O thread
 attempts to make an I/O call with the interrupt status set the call will
 immediately fail with a <code>ClosedByInterruptException</code>.

 @brief Closes the channel.
 <p>
 Any threads that are blocked on I/O operations on this channel will be
 interrupted with an <code>AsynchronousCloseException</code>. Otherwise, this
 method behaves the same as defined in the <code>Channel</code> interface.
 @throws IOException
 if an I/O error occurs while closing the channel.
